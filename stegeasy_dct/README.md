#### DCT:
QUANTISATION: MAPPING LARGE SET OF INPUT VALUES TO A SMALL SET OF OUTPUT VALUES
Quantisation create bias towards low frequency ones and reduces high frequency ones to a small value
##### frequency = rate of change of intensity/pixel
##### low frequency when it takes more pixels to change colour in an image
##### high frequency when it takes less pixels for colour transformation
##### lower frequencies are easily identifieable by human eye
